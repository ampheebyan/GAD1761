# weapons
This branch will be used for testing weapon changes, or implementing new weapon functionality. It will not be regularly merged into any other branches other than `enemy-testing` (not started) and `main`.

# GAD176.1 - Game Scripting 2 Project One
## What is this?
Initial work will be on a reusable FPS framework, which upon completion will be moved into a separate branch dedicated to preserving it for submission later on.  
Extended work on a project using this reusable FPS framework will take place on the main branch after this.  

Work on the project can be watched through looking at active branches and pull requests, and the project card page.
